| File Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| battery-holder.stl | We positioned our battery within this design to optimize weight distribution, contributing to the overall balance and stability of the robot.
| circuit-holder.stl | We securely housed our circuit in this holder to ensure it remains protected and stable, minimizing the risk of wires touching or becoming disconnected, which could lead to performance issues during the competition.
| servo.stl |We mounted both our servo and Pixy camera on the same attachment for two key reasons. First, the servo motor needed to be positioned at the front of the robot to effectively control the steering mechanism. Second, this attachment offered the ideal height and placement for the Pixy camera, ensuring it has the best field of view for accurate object detection. |
| shaft.stl, steer-shaft.stl, steering-holder.stl, steering-plate.stl, wheel-mount.stl | These CAD files contain the complete design of our steering mechanism. |
