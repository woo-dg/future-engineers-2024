This directory consists of the different materials used to construct our robot, along with the reasoning for choosing our drivetrain. 

## Chassis Type & Explanation

We opted for a straightforward chassis design, prioritizing simplicity to minimize complexity and reduce the potential for mechanical failures. After consideration, we chose a drivetrain with rear-wheel drive coupled with front-wheel steering. This decision was based on our experience with similar rear-wheel-driven LEGO robots, making the control of our robot more familiar.

Utilizing all four wheels proved advantageous, particularly in maintaining a small turning radius, which is important for maneuverability in tight spaces. Additionally, we designed the wheelbase-to-track ratio to be 1:1.6. This specific ratio was selected to optimize stability, ensuring that our robot maintains a controlled movement even during sharp turns and complex maneuvers.
