This directory consists of the different materials used to construct our robot, along with the reasoning for choosing our drivetrain. 

## Chassis Type & Explanation

We opted for a straightforward chassis design, prioritizing simplicity to minimize complexity and reduce the potential for mechanical failures. After consideration, we chose a drivetrain with rear-wheel drive coupled with front-wheel steering. This decision was based on our experience with similar rear-wheel-driven LEGO robots, making the control of our robot more familiar.

Utilizing all four wheels proved advantageous, particularly in maintaining a small turning radius, which is important for maneuverability in tight spaces. Additionally, we designed the wheelbase-to-track ratio to be 1:1.6. This specific ratio was selected to optimize stability, ensuring that our robot maintains a controlled movement even during sharp turns and complex maneuvers.

## Steering

Our steering mechanism employs Ackerman steering geometry, where the servo motor adjusts the bar, altering the wheel angles and, consequently, the vehicle's direction. This type of steering proved to be the most efficient for our needs and was straightforward to implement, requiring only a servo motor and a simple linkage that connects the servo to the wheel axles. This design choice not only enhanced maneuverability but also simplified the overall construction process.

## Materials

When creating our robot, we aimed to easily iterate and update the design as we tested it. To achieve this flexibility, we CAD-designed several different versions of the same parts, allowing us to test and determine which were the most effective and properly optimized for the overall design of the robot. This approach helped us identify the optimal configuration for our robot's performance.
