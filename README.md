This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the 2023 season. More information on each subcomponent of the robot is placed in the README.md files in each folder.

## Content
* `build` contains documentation about our chassis and material choice
* `electrical` contains schematic diagrams demonstrating the connections between different electromechanical components. It also includes the available datasheets for the aforementioned components, and it also has a markdown file explaining the reasoning for each component.
* `models` contains the files used by 3D printers to produce the vehicle elements.
* `photos` contains two folders where one contains the team photos and the other contains the robot photos
* `src` contains the code of control software for all components that were programmed to participate in the competition
* `strategy` contains documentation and diagrams explaining our approach to the problem
